# VoVNet2 and CenterMask2

The code is based on the original [VoVNet2](https://github.com/youngwanLEE/vovnet-detectron2)
and [CenterMask2](https://github.com/youngwanLEE/centermask2) projects.

This is currently a work-in-progress, but the VoVNet2 is functional. 


## TODO
- [ ] Basic Tox testing
- [ ] GitHub Actions CI

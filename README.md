# VoVNet2 and CenterMask2

![CI](https://github.com/alexwitt2399/vovnet/workflows/Python3%20CI/badge.svg?branch=master)

The code is based on the original [VoVNet2](https://github.com/youngwanLEE/vovnet-detectron2)
and [CenterMask2](https://github.com/youngwanLEE/centermask2) projects.

This is currently a work-in-progress, but the VoVNet2 is functional. 


## TODO
- [X] Basic Tox testing
- [X] GitHub Actions CI
